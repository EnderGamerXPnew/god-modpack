it's recommended to the keep the modpack as he zip file or on he external drive when not use

some unfished item/block by there respective modder might also crash or corrupt world here is the list of what i found bugie:

-ex rolloaster block/invisible rail CORRUPT (when placed make the current dimension file unreadable forcing you to reset the dimension in question by using world edit)



-npc creator item/magic wand CRASH (it's he theory but when the right click action are trigger the wand try to connect you into he dead server)



-securitycraft block/security camera PARTIALSOFTLOCK (the camera only to is default key control even if the mod try to make you otherwise)
